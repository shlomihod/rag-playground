# 2025 New England Patriots season

The 2025 season was the New England Patriots' 56th in the National Football League (NFL), their 66th overall, their second under de facto general manager Eliot Wolf, their first under head coach Mike Vrabel, and their 12th Super Bowl appearance. The Patriots clinched their first winning season since 2021 with a Week 11 victory over the division rival New York Jets, and guaranteed they would exceed their combined win total for the 2023 and 2024 seasons. With a Week 16 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, the Patriots made the playoffs for the first time since 2021 under Bill Belichick. Their Week 17 victory over the Jets, combined with a Bills loss that same week, gave the Patriots their first AFC East championship since 2019 and their first division championship without Tom Brady or Bill Belichick since 1997. Their Week 18 victory over the Miami Dolphins tied them for the largest single-season turnaround in NFL history, at 10 games. The Patriots earned the No. 2 seed, finishing tied with the Denver Broncos for the No. 1 seed; however, Denver earned the No. 1 seed based on the common opponents tiebreaker.
This season began with the Patriots' third head coach in as many seasons following the dismissal of first-year head coach Jerod Mayo after the final game of the 2024 season. Patriots Hall of Fame inductee Mike Vrabel, who played for the team from 2001 to 2008, was hired as the franchise's 16th head coach on January 12. Before coaching New England, Vrabel was head coach of the Tennessee Titans from 2018 to 2023.
With the retirement of center David Andrews and the release of long snapper Joe Cardona, linebacker Ja'Whaun Bentley, defensive end Deatrich Wise, cornerback Jonathan Jones, and quarterback Jacoby Brissett, this is the Patriots' first season since 1992 that their roster had no players who won, or would go on to win, a Super Bowl with the Patriots.
Their .824 winning percentage was their best since their Super Bowl LI-winning 2016 season, making them the first NFL team since the 1999 Indianapolis Colts to suffer two consecutive seasons with 13 losses and win 13 or more games in the third. This is also their first season with 10 consecutive wins since 2015, and their first with both a 4,000 yard passer and 1,000 yard receiver since 2019. In addition, the 2025 Patriots had the second easiest schedule since league realignment in 2002; its historically low strength of schedule was .391 and the team played only three regular-season games against opponents that finished with winning records. These were the Pittsburgh Steelers once and Buffalo Bills twice. They became the first team in NFL history to finish 9–0 on the road. They also became the first team since the 2004 Steelers to lose double-digit games in one season and finish the next season with 14 or more wins.
For their efforts this season, Mike Vrabel and Josh McDaniels received NFL Coach of the Year and NFL Assistant Coach of the Year, respectively. Vrabel became the first Patriots head coach to receive the award since Bill Belichick in 2010. It was his second time winning the award, with the first being in 2021 with the Tennessee Titans. Meanwhile, McDaniels became the first Patriots assistant coach to receive the award since its introduction in 2014.
In the postseason, the Patriots faced the Los Angeles Chargers in the Wild Card Round, winning with a score of 16–3. It would be their first playoff victory since Super Bowl LIII. The following week, they went up against the Houston Texans in the Divisional Round, winning with a 28–16 score. Following that, the Patriots traveled to Denver for the AFC Championship, defeating the Broncos with a score of 10–7. It would be their first postseason victory both on the road and in the conference championship since 2018. The Patriots became the first team in NFL history to defeat three top-five ranked defenses in a single postseason. They are also the first team in NFL history to reach the Super Bowl after losing 13 or more games the previous season. In Super Bowl LX, they faced the Seattle Seahawks in a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX. It was their 12th Super Bowl appearance, extending an NFL record. The Patriots lost by a score of 29–13, preventing them from winning their seventh Super Bowl title, and in doing so became the first NFL franchise to lose six Super Bowls, breaking a tie they previously shared with the Denver Broncos.
