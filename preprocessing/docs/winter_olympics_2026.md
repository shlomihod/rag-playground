# 2026 Winter Olympics

The 2026 Winter Olympics (Italian: Olimpiadi invernali del 2026), officially the XXV Winter Olympic Games and commonly known as Milano Cortina 2026, is an international multi-sport event currently taking place from 6 to 22 February 2026 at multiple sites across Lombardy and Northeast Italy, with competition in selected events beginning 4 February 2026. The 2026 Games are scheduled to feature the debut of ski mountaineering as a Winter Olympic event, and are the first Olympic Games under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Kirsty Coventry.
A joint bid by Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo was awarded the 2026 Winter Olympics at the 134th IOC Session in June 2019, beating another joint bid made by Stockholm and Åre, Sweden. Milano Cortina 2026 is the first Olympic Games to be officially co-hosted by two cities. Milan primarily hosts the ice events, while the remaining events are hosted in clusters around Cortina, Livigno, and Fiemme. These marked the third Winter Olympics, and the fourth Olympics overall, to be hosted by Italy; Cortina d'Ampezzo previously hosted the 1956 Winter Olympics.


Bidding process


Host city selection
Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo were selected as the host cities on 24 June 2019 at the 134th IOC Session in Lausanne, Switzerland. The three Italian International Olympic Committee (IOC) members (Franco Carraro, Ivo Ferriani, and Giovanni Malagò) and two Swedish IOC members (Gunilla Lindberg and Stefan Holm) were ineligible to vote as stated in the Olympic Charter.


Development and preparations


Venues

The Games are primarily utilizing existing venues across Lombardy and Northeast Italy, including those used by the 1956 Winter Olympics previously held in Cortina d'Ampezzo, and by the 2013 Winter Universiade hosted by the province of Trentino. Most ice events, aside from curling, are held in the Milan cluster, while sliding and snow events are held in clusters around Cortina, Valtellina, and the Fiemme Valley. A new 12,000-seat multi-use arena designed by David Chipperfield constructed in Milan's Santa Giulia district hosts ice hockey. Stadio San Siro in Milan hosted the opening ceremony, and the historic Verona Arena in Verona is scheduled to host the closing ceremony. Athletes stay in several Olympic villages, depending on the location of their sport; Milan Olympic Village, Cortina d'Ampezzo Olympic Village, or in hotels.

Speed skating venue selection
During the bidding process, the bidding committee proposed that the speed skating events could be held at the existing Ice Rink Piné in Baselga di Piné. Despite the infrastructure being ready, it required a roof, which impact and cost studies indicated would be costly, potentially exceeding the budget. The committee deliberated over three choices: building an ice rink in the pavilions of Fiera Milano (with a possibility to be permanent or temporary), options that would require significant structural work, or move the events to the Oval Lingotto in the city of Turin, which required no structural changes.
The venue, which was constructed to host speed skating during the 2006 Winter Olympics and after the Games, has hosted events such as exhibitions, fairs, and conferences. The venue hosted the same sport in the 2007 Winter Universiade. In April 2023, it was estimated that the temporary ice rink in Fiera Milano would cost nearly €20 million, which would be paid for with private funds. The proposal to use Turin's Oval Lingotto received opposition from Milan-area officials, as Turin was part of the initial stages of the project but later withdrew. One of the spokespersons to reject this proposal was Giuseppe Sala (the mayor of Milan) and officials from the host regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Fiera Milano was confirmed as the speed skating venue in April 2023.


Olympic torch

The Olympic torch relay started on 26 November 2025 with the flame lighting in Olympia, Greece, and concluded on 6 February 2026 in Milan, Italy, coinciding with the opening ceremony at Stadio San Siro. Along with the 13 regional units and seven regions in Greece, the flame was scheduled to visit the 110 provinces of Italy, making 60 stops over 63 days across 12,000 kilometres (7,500 mi). The Olympic torch was unveiled on 14 April 2025 in parallel events held in Milan and Osaka, Japan. It was simultaneously revealed at the Triennale di Milano and at the Italian pavilion at Expo 2025 as a way of connecting the two sister cities, as Milan had previously hosted Expo 2015. The Olympic torch is light blue whereas the corresponding Paralympic torch is bronze coloured. Named "Essential"; developed by Eni and its subsidiary Versalis, designed by Studio Carlo Ratti Associati and produced in Italy by Cavagna Group, the torches are made primarily of an alloy of recycled aluminium and bronze. They run bio-LPG, a fuel made from renewable materials, produced at the Enilive biorefinery in Gela, and have been designed to be refilled up to ten times in order to cut down on the number of torches produced.
Following the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, there was a low-key handover ceremony in Athens on 4 December 2025. The flame then arrived in Rome to visit all 110 provinces of Italy, making 60 stops over 63 days across 12,000 kilometres (7,500 mi) and involving 10,001 torchbearers. The torch was in Naples for Christmas, in Bari for New Year's Eve, and in Cortina d'Ampezzo on 26 January to commemorate the 70th anniversary of its hosting the 1956 Winter Olympics. While the torch was in Piedmont, a tribute was planned for skier Matilde Lorenzi, who died while training in October 2024. The torch relay was scheduled to visit every UNESCO World Heritage Site in Italy.
