Selected third overall by New England in the 2024 NFL draft, Maye earned Pro Bowl honors during his rookie season. The following year, he led the Patriots to their first division title since 2019 en route to an appearance in Super Bowl LX, while receiving a second consecutive Pro Bowl selection and second-team All-Pro honors.


Early life

Maye was born on August 30, 2002, in Huntersville, North Carolina. He attended William A. Hough High School in Cornelius, North Carolina, and transferred after his freshman year to Myers Park High School in Charlotte, where he played football and basketball. He has three brothers, who also played football. Two of his brothers, Luke and Cole, won national championships playing collegiate sports. 
Drake Maye and his brothers were competitive with each other.  As a junior in high school, he received All-Conference and All-District honors in basketball and was named The Charlotte Observer's 2019 male athlete of the year after throwing for a school-record 3,512 yards and 50 touchdowns en route to a conference championship appearance. Maye was named a Under Armour All-American in 2020 despite being unable to play his senior season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rated a four-star prospect, Maye committed to play college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide in July 2019 before flipping to North Carolina in Chapel Hill in March 2020.
Maye grew up a fan of the Carolina Panthers and attended Super Bowl 50 at Levi's Stadium.


College career

As a redshirt in his freshman season for the North Carolina Tar Heels, Maye appeared in four games behind starter Sam Howell in 2021. With Howell leaving for the NFL in 2022, Maye was named the starter prior to the season. In the opening game against Florida A&M, he threw five touchdowns and became the first UNC quarterback to do so in his debut. Maye had four or more touchdowns  in games against Appalachian State, Notre Dame, Virginia Tech, Pittsburgh, and Wake Forest. He led the team to appearances in the 2022 ACC Championship Game and Holiday Bowl and was named the ACC Player of the Year after leading the NCAA in total offense with 5,019, passing for school-records 4,321 yards and 38 touchdowns while rushing for 698 yards and 7 touchdowns.
In the 2023 season, Maye threw for over 400 yards against Syracuse, Miami, and Campbell University. He was named second-team All-ACC after passing for 3,608 yards and 24 touchdowns while rushing for 449 yards and nine touchdowns. He declared for the 2024 NFL draft following the season. He finished his career fifth in passing yards (8,018) and fourth in passing touchdowns (63) in UNC history.


Professional career


2024

The New England Patriots selected Maye with the third overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft. He was the first Patriot since Drew Bledsoe in 1993 selected in the top five picks of the draft, and the third of a record-tying six quarterbacks taken in the first round (tied with the 1983 draft). The Patriots reportedly declined offers for their pick from the Minnesota Vikings and New York Giants that would have included additional first-round draft picks.
Maye signed a four-year, fully-guaranteed contract worth $36.64 million on May 28, 2024. He was the second consecutive Patriots first-round rookie quarterback to choose the number 10, following Mac Jones. Despite a strong preseason, Maye was named a backup to veteran Jacoby Brissett to begin his rookie season. Maye made his regular season debut in Week 3, entering in the fourth quarter of the Patriots' 24–3 road loss to the New York Jets. Maye finished the game, completing four of eight passes for 22 yards and rushing for 12 yards. On October 8, 2024, after the Patriots fell to 1–4 and continued struggles from Brissett, Maye was named the starting quarterback. In his first start against the Houston Texans, Maye completed 20 of 33 passes for 243 yards with 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions in the 41–21 loss; he also led the team with 38 rushing yards. Maye's three touchdowns were one more than Brissett had thrown in his five 2024 starts, and Maye became the first quarterback since at least 1950 to throw three touchdown passes and lead his team in rushing in his first start. In Week 8 against the Jets, Maye recorded a rushing touchdown before exiting the game in the second quarter with a head injury, later diagnosed as a concussion. The Patriots would go on to win 25–22. The Patriots finished the season with a 4–13 record and did not make the playoffs.
Maye finished his rookie season throwing for 2,276 yards with 15 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. Maye's first 10 passing touchdowns went to ten different receivers, making him the first NFL quarterback to accomplish that feat since Steve Ramsey did so in 1973. In January 2025, Maye was selected to play in the 2025 Pro Bowl Games as a replacement for Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen.


2025

The 2025 season began with changes in the Patriots' coaching staff with the hiring of new head coach Mike Vrabel and the return of offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. Vrabel cited the presence of Maye as being one of his reasons for taking the position. During the 2025 season, Maye was given the nickname of "Drake Maye", as Patriots teammates started referring to him as Drake "Drake Maye" Maye. The origin of the nickname is unclear, and it became a popular meme.
In Week 5 against the Buffalo Bills, Maye completed 22 of 30 passes for 273 yards, including leading a 37-yard game-winning drive to allow Andrés Borregales to convert a 52-yard field goal with 15 seconds left to win the game 23–20.
