# Jason Myers

Jason Myers (born May 12, 1991) is an American professional football placekicker for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Marist Red Foxes. Myers played for the Jacksonville Jaguars and New York Jets. He kicked five field goals in Super Bowl LX for the Seahawks, setting the record for the most field goals in a Super Bowl. Myers also scored 206 combined points in the 2025 regular season and postseason to set a new NFL record.


Early life and high school career
Myers was born on May 12, 1991, in Chula Vista, California to Donny and Mary Myers. He attended Mater Dei Catholic High School, where he played varsity football for four years and was named Mesa Kicker of the Year. Myers also played soccer, winning a state championship and being named San Diego Division IV CIF Player of the Year.


College career
Per Myers' own description, he was a "late bloomer" in high school and was not heavily recruited by college programs. Myers attended Marist University in Poughkeepsie, New York from 2009 to 2012, serving as their starting kicker all four years. As a freshman, he kicked a 37-yard field goal with two seconds remaining to narrowly win 23–21 against Georgetown and was named PFL Special Teams Player of the Week. As a senior, Myers also acted as Marist's primary punter.
During his collegiate career, Myers made 24 field goals out of 38 attempts. He left as Marist's all-time leading scorer among placekickers, also holding the program record for longest field goal (49 yards against Davidson in 2011). Myers was a three-time honorable mention for the All-PFL team.


Professional career
After his college career, Myers received no attention from professional scouts and returned to the San Diego metropolitan area. He worked as a valet while continuing to train and briefly joined the Arena Football League with the San Jose SaberCats and Arizona Rattlers. Myers later wrote that he still lacked proper kicking technique at this point, as Marist had no special teams coordinator and he had been largely self-taught. In August 2014, he began training with Michael Husted, a nine-year veteran NFL kicker. Through Husted, Myers was invited to a tryout at the 2015 Senior Bowl, and shortly after signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars.


Jacksonville Jaguars
On March 3, 2015, Myers signed with the Jaguars. He became just the third player from Marist to sign with an NFL team. 


2015 season
Myers performed well in the preseason, making four of five field goal attempts, including one from 55 yards. On August 31, the Jaguars announced Myers had earned the starting role after trading veteran kicker Josh Scobee to the Pittsburgh Steelers. In Week 2 against the Miami Dolphins, Myers connected on a 58 yard field goal, one yard short of the Jaguars franchise record, and a game-winning 28-yarder with 40 seconds remaining. For the season, Myers converted 26 of 30 field goal attempts but struggled with extra points, converting 32 of 39 for a league-leading seven misses.


2016 season
Myers was more consistent to start the 2016 season, making all of his first 13 attempts under 50 yards. In total, Myers made 27 field goals from 34 attempts and 29 extra points from 32 attempts. He led the league with 12 attempts above 50 yards, tying for second most made with seven. He was named the best kickoff kicker in 2016 by Pro Football Focus.


2017 season
On October 17, 2017, after six games, Myers was released by the Jaguars. In the prior three weeks, he had missed three field goals: a 52-yard attempt against the New York Jets and two 54-yard attempts against the Los Angeles Rams, both by a "significant margin".


Seattle Seahawks (first stint)
On January 3, 2018, Myers signed with the Seattle Seahawks. On August 20, he was released after losing the starting kicking job to veteran Sebastian Janikowski.


New York Jets
On August 21, 2018, Myers was claimed off waivers by the New York Jets. He became the starting kicker after Taylor Bertolet was waived after the preseason.
During Week 6, Myers broke the Jets' franchise record for field goals with seven against the Indianapolis Colts as the Jets won 42–34. Myers was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance. In the 2018 season, Myers converted 30 of 33 extra point attempts and 33 of 36 field goal attempts. He was named to the Pro Bowl for his performance during the 2018 season.


Seattle Seahawks (second stint)
On March 14, 2019, Myers signed a four-year, $15.45 million contract with the Seahawks.


2019 season
On November 3, 2019, Myers missed two field goals against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, including a potential game-winning kick at the end of regulation. Nevertheless, the Seahawks would go on to win in overtime, 40–34. In the next game, in a Monday Night Football matchup, Myers connected on both of his field goal attempts, including the game-winning 42-yard kick in overtime with no time left on the clock, to lift the Seahawks over the San Francisco 49ers 27–24 and move their record to 8–2 on the season. In the 2019 season, Myers converted 40 of 44 extra point attempts and 23 of 28 field goal attempts.


2020 season
On November 15, 2020, in a Week 10 game against the Rams, Myers hit a career long and Seahawks franchise record long 61-yard field goal as time expired in the first half. On December 20, in a Week 15 game against the Washington Football Team, Myers kicked his 31st consecutive successful field goal, breaking the previous Seahawks record, held by Olindo Mare. He would finish the season a perfect 24-of-24 on field goal attempts, and 49 for 53 extra point attempts.


2021 season

Myers' consecutive field goal streak would reach 37 straight field goals, the 4th longest streak in NFL history. On September 26, 2021, against the Minnesota Vikings, the streak ended as he missed a 44-yard field goal attempt wide left.
