# Alpine skiing at the 2026 Winter Olympics

Alpine skiing at the 2026 Winter Olympics was held between 7 and 18 February 2026.
All five men's events were held in Bormio at the Stelvio ski course; and all five women's events were held in Cortina d'Ampezzo at the Olimpia delle Tofane ski course, both very demanding.
A total of 306 quota spots were distributed to alpine skiing. 
Ten events were contested (down from 11 in 2022), split evenly between men and women. The mixed parallel team event was dropped after the 2022 Winter Olympics, while the alpine combined event in each gender was replaced by a team combined event for pairs.
