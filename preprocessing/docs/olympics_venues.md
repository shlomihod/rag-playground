# Venues of the 2026 Winter Olympics and Paralympics

The 2026 Winter Olympics and 2026 Winter Paralympics, hosted by the cities of Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, will make use of 25 event venues across four clusters in northern Italy. These consist of nineteen existing venues, two newly built venues, and four temporary venues. Over 90% of the venues are either pre-existing or temporary. The Games are reportedly set to be the most geographically widespread in winter Olympic history; the use of existing venues means the events will be held in an area spanning more than 22,000 square kilometres (8,500 sq mi).


Milano Cluster
Milan contains four competition venues for four Olympic sports and one Paralympic sport. Construction on a new 16,000-seat ice hockey venue in the Santa Giulia area commenced on 28 November 2023 at an initial estimate of €180 million; however, an additional €70–90 million is reportedly needed due to rising costs of energy and materials. Six buildings that will comprise an Olympic and Paralympic Village in Milan are being built at the railyard of the Milano Porta Romana railway station; the project's initial cost of €100 million was later revised to €140 million. Temporary arenas are being built at the Fiera Milano Rho complex for ice hockey and speed skating at a cost of €15 million.

Cortina Cluster
Cortina d'Ampezzo contains four competition venues for five Olympic sports and three Paralympic sports. In addition, the venue for biathlon is located in Antholz.
Impresa Pizzarotti has started on construction of a new bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track in Cortina d'Ampezzo at a cost of €81 million. The government of Italy made the decision to rebuild the former track in Cortina d'Ampezzo used during the 1956 Winter Olympics despite opposition from the International Olympic Committee. The project has received criticism from environmental groups due to the planned felling of 20,000 square metres (220,000 sq ft) of larch forest. However, there are concerns that the venue will not be finished in time for the Games; Mt. Van Hoevenberg Olympic Bobsled Run in Lake Placid, United States, has been selected as the back-up venue for the sliding events. Venues in Austria (Olympic Sliding Centre Innsbruck in Igls) and Switzerland (St. Moritz-Celerina Olympic Bobrun in St. Moritz) were previously discussed as back-up sites.
Construction has also started on the temporary Olympic and Paralympic Village in the ground of former Cortina Airport in Fiames, located north of Cortina d'Ampezzo. It will accommodate around 1,400 guests and has a cost of around €39 million. In addition, the Olympic Village at Anterselva will use existing hotels.
