# 2025 Seattle Seahawks season

The 2025 season was the Seattle Seahawks' 50th in the National Football League (NFL), their 16th under general manager John Schneider, and their second under head coach Mike Macdonald. The Seahawks finished the regular season with a franchise-best 14–3 record, winning the NFC West for the first time since 2020 and securing the NFC’s No. 1 seed for the first time since 2014. They went on to win Super Bowl LX, defeating the New England Patriots 29–13 to capture their second Super Bowl championship and first since the 2013 season.
The offseason saw significant roster changes, as longtime players Tyler Lockett, Geno Smith, and DK Metcalf departed the team. Lockett was released and later signed with the Tennessee Titans, while Smith joined the Las Vegas Raiders and Metcalf was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Key free agent additions included quarterback Sam Darnold, wide receiver Cooper Kupp, and linebacker DeMarcus Lawrence, and the team re-signed linebacker Ernest Jones IV to a three-year contract. On November 4, prior to the trade deadline, Seattle acquired All-Pro returner and wide receiver Rashid Shaheed from the New Orleans Saints.
Seattle improved upon their 10–7 record from 2024 and clinched a playoff berth in Week 16 with an overtime victory over the rival Los Angeles Rams on Thursday Night Football, ending a two-year postseason absence. The team won 13 games for the first time since 2013 and secured a franchise-record 14 regular-season victories with a 13–3 win over the San Francisco 49ers in Week 18. In a divisional round rematch against San Francisco, the Seahawks earned their first playoff victory since 2019 and advanced to their first NFC Championship Game since 2014. They became the first Super Bowl champion to complete an entire postseason without committing a turnover.
Individually, Jaxon Smith-Njigba set a franchise single-season record with 1,793 receiving yards, surpassing DK Metcalf’s previous mark of 1,303 set in 2020. The Seahawks also posted a franchise-record point differential of +191, breaking the previous record of +186 established during the 2013 Super Bowl-winning season.

With the loss, the Seahawks started their season 0–1.


Week 2: at Pittsburgh Steelers

At the beginning of the fourth quarter, the game-deciding play occurred following a Seahawks field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Steelers returner Kaleb Johnson failed to go after the ball, mistakenly thinking it was not live. However, because the ball landed in the kickoff landing zone, it was considered live, allowing Seahawks player George Holani to recover it in the end zone for a touchdown.


Week 3: vs. New Orleans Saints

Wide Receiver Tory Horton ran a 95-yard punt return for a touchdown, setting a franchise record for the longest punt return. With the blowout win, the Seahawks improved to 2–1.


Week 4: at Arizona Cardinals
With their eighth consecutive win over Arizona, the Seahawks improved to 3–1.


Week 5: vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers

With both clubs celebrating their respective 50th seasons, both teams wore throwback uniforms. In a shootout, Sam Darnold sealed the game late for Tampa Bay when he threw an interception to Lavonte David, allowing the Buccaneers to set up the decisive field goal by Chase McLaughlin as time expired.

Jaxon Smith-Njigba became the first NFL receiver to eclipse 1,000 receiving yards this season.

The loss ended the Seahawks’ 10-game road winning streak, marking their first road defeat since losing to the Lions in Detroit during the 2024 season. This would also be their final loss of this season, as they would go on a 10-game winning streak that culminated in their Super Bowl LX victory.
