# Figure skating at the 2026 Winter Olympics

The figure skating events at the 2026 Winter Olympics were held from 6 to 19 February at the Milano Ice Skating Arena in Milan, Italy. Medals were awarded in men's singles, women's singles, pair skating, ice dance, and the team event.


Background
Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Olympic Committee suspended the Russian Olympic Committee and banned all Russian and Belarusian athletes from competition. The skating federations of Russia and Belarus were each permitted to nominate one skater or team from each discipline to participate at the Skate to Milano as a means to qualify for the 2026 Winter Olympics as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs). Each nominee was required to pass a special screening process to assess whether they had displayed any active support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine or any contractual links to the Russian or Belarusian military. Petr Gumennik and Adeliia Petrosian, both of Russia, and Viktoriia Safonova of Belarus earned spots at the Olympics as Individual Neutral Athletes.


Qualification

A total of 142 quota spots were available to athletes to compete in figure skating at the 2026 Winter Olympics. Each National Olympic Committee (NOC) was allowed to enter a maximum of 18 skaters, with a maximum of nine men or nine women. The results of the 2025 World Figure Skating Championships determined 83 total spots: 24 entries each in men's and women's singles, 15 in pair skating, and 18 in ice dance. The remaining quota spots were allocated based on the results of the Skate to Milano.


Competition schedule
All times are in local time (UTC+1), according to the official schedule correct as of December 2025.


Entries
Countries began announcing their selections following the 2025 World Championships. The International Skating Union published a complete list of entries on 26 January 2026. Skaters or teams denoted with ● are eligible for the team event only.
Finland had originally qualified for two quota spots in the ice dance event at the 2025 World Championships; however, when Yuka Orihara was unable to obtain Finnish citizenship, Skating Finland ultimately relinquished their second quota spot. As a result, the spot was reallocated to Sweden, and Milla Ruud Reitan and Nikolaj Majorov became the first Swedish ice dance team to ever qualify for the Winter Olympics. 
Additionally, Uzbekistan originally qualified one quota spot in the pairs event after Ekaterina Geynish and Dmitrii Chigirev finished in tenth place at the 2025 World Championships. However, after Geynish and Chigirev ended their partnership, the spot was re-allocated to France, who chose to send Camille Kovalev and Pavel Kovalev.
Meda Variakojytė of Lithuania also made history as the first Lithuanian women's singles skater to qualify for the Winter Olympic Games. Moreover, Daria Danilova and Michel Tsiba of the Netherlands became the first Dutch pair skating team to qualify for the Winter Olympics.
