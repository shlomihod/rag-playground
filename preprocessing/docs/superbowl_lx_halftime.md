# Super Bowl LX halftime show

The Super Bowl LX halftime show, officially known as the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show for sponsorship purposes, took place on February 8, 2026, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It was headlined by Bad Bunny and featured guest appearances from Lady Gaga, Ricky Martin, and Los Pleneros de la Cresta. The performance marked the first time a Latino solo artist headlined the Super Bowl halftime show and the first halftime set performed almost entirely in Spanish.
The show was broadcast across the US on NBC, Peacock, Telemundo, Universo, NFL+ and select NBC Sports digital platforms. It drew 128.2 million viewers domestically across all platforms—making it the fourth-most-watched halftime show in history—and attracted 4.8 million viewers on Telemundo, the network's largest audience for an American football broadcast. It was met with widespread critical acclaim, with critics praising the performance, production, tone, and themes. Analysts highlighted the show's social commentary on Puerto Rico's history, its pan-Latino cultural affirmation, and its recontextualization of "America" and "American" to encompass the entire continent.


Background
On September 9, 2025, it was reported that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell hinted that singer-songwriter Taylor Swift could be the headliner for the halftime show. He said when asked if it is possible that Swift could do the show: "We would always love to have [Swift] play. She is a special, special talent, and obviously she would be welcome at any time". When asked by Today co-host Savannah Guthrie if an appearance from Swift was in the works, Goodell said "I can't tell you anything about it". Swift, for the third time in four years, declined the opportunity.
It was initially reported that Swift had asked for an appearance fee and full copyrights to the show, which the NFL does not provide to performers. However, Swift later said that she had rejected the possibility during early conversations with Roc Nation because she was unwilling to perform in a game in which her fiancé Travis Kelce could be a participant, since it would detract from her enjoyment of the game by having to focus on the details of a concert. Swift's concerns were rendered moot after Kelce's team, the Kansas City Chiefs, were eliminated from postseason contention on December 14, 2025. Billboard also reported that potential headliners included Lady Gaga (who headlined the Super Bowl LI halftime show in 2017), Mariah Carey, Justin Bieber, Drake, BTS, Green Day, Metallica, and Jay-Z.


Announcement
Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny was officially announced as the headliner for the Halftime Show on September 28, 2025, by the NFL in partnership with Apple Music and Jay-Z's Roc Nation. Bad Bunny was the first Latino and Spanish-speaking artist to headline the Super Bowl halftime show as a solo act. He previously performed as a special guest at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show, alongside headliners Shakira and Jennifer Lopez.
In a statement, Bad Bunny highlighted the cultural significance of the event, saying, "This is for my people, my culture, and our history." Earlier in the year, Bad Bunny declined to hold concerts in the mainland US and reserved Puerto Rican shows to archipelago and island residents due to concerns over raids executed by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). A day before the announcement, Bad Bunny said, "I've been thinking about it these days, and after discussing it with my team, I think I'll do just one date in the US."


NFL Latino audience strategy
Bad Bunny's selection came amid the NFL's intensified efforts to grow its Latino fanbase, which the league identified as essential to its expansion strategy. In 2024, NFL Senior Vice President of Global Brand and Consumer Marketing Marissa Solis stated that league growth "is mathematically impossible without Latinos", pointing to over 39 million Latino fans in the US—one of the largest Latino fanbases in American sports. The league's "Por La Cultura" campaign, launched in 2021, represents an ongoing initiative to cultivate Latino audiences through Spanish-language broadcasts, cultural partnerships, and storytelling featuring Latino players.
The selection also reflected the growing economic influence of Latino consumers in the US. A 2025 McKinsey & Company report projected that Latinos would account for one-third of total US sports market growth by 2035. Super Bowl LX featured the broadest Spanish-language broadcast distribution in Super Bowl history, with both Fox Deportes and Telemundo producing separate Spanish-language coverage of the game.


Reception to selection
Reactions to the announcement were mixed, with most opposition coming from conservative commentators. Many positive responses highlighted the selection as a milestone for Latino representation. California governor Gavin Newsom was "excited" to welcome Bad Bunny to the state, and declared February 8, 2026, as Bad Bunny Day to commemorate the performance. Univision highlighted the pride of the Latino community, while celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Bruno Mars, Shakira, Jelly Roll, and Jay‑Z expressed their support. Reports emphasized the economic and cultural impact of his concerts in Puerto Rico. NFL officials stated that Bad Bunny's selection was an important way to be relevant to its growing Latino fanbase, and that it was part of a broader effort to engage the community of over 70 million Latinos in the US.
Conservative influencers and political figures questioned the selection, criticizing Bad Bunny for his opposition to President Donald Trump and ICE. Some critical commentators also noted that Bad Bunny performs primarily in Spanish and had avoided including mainland US dates in his Debí Tirar Más Fotos World Tour due to concerns about potential ICE raids. Trump described the announcement as "absolutely ridiculous". US secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem announced that ICE agents would be present at the Super Bowl.
