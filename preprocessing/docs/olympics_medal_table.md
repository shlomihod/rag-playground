Medals

The official medals of the Games were unveiled in Venice, designed as two halves that symbolise the culmination of an athlete's journey and of all those who have walked beside them along the way. The medals were created by the Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato (IPZS). They have an essential design that places emotion and teamwork at its core. They feature the traditional Olympic five-ring symbol on one side with an inscription on the reverse that details the event and commemorates the two host cities.


Medal table

The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.
