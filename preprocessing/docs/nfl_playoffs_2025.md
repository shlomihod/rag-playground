# 2025–26 NFL playoffs

The National Football League playoffs for the 2025 season began on January 10, 2026, and concluded with Super Bowl LX on February 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.
This is the first postseason since 2014 not to feature the Kansas City Chiefs. Additionally, it marks the first postseason since 1998 not to feature Peyton Manning, Tom Brady or Patrick Mahomes.
It is also the first postseason since 2022 to not feature either number one seed from the previous season – the Kansas City Chiefs and Detroit Lions.
With the Los Angeles Rams and Carolina Panthers facing each other in the NFC Wild Card Round, the Rams became the first team in NFL history to face every team within their respective conference in the postseason at least twice.
With the Houston Texans and Pittsburgh Steelers facing each other in the AFC Wild Card Round, the Steelers became the fifth team in NFL history (Rams, Eagles, Bills, Chiefs) to face every team within their respective conference in the postseason at least once.
A total of 12 fourth-quarter lead changes occurred in the first four of the six wild card games played. These four games (Rams–Panthers, Packers–Bears, Bills–Jaguars and 49ers–Eagles) were decided by a winning touchdown inside the final three minutes.
Two of the four divisional round games went into overtime, the second time this has occurred since the AFL–NFL merger. In both games (Bills–Broncos and Rams–Bears), the winning team started overtime punting on their first drive, intercepted the ball on defense, then kicked a game-winning field goal on their second drive.
The conference championships were unwatchable in parts of the southern United States due to power outages that resulted from a series of winter storms.
For the fourth time in eight years, both conference championship games were decided by seven points or less.


Participants

Within each conference, the four division winners and the top three non-division winners with the best overall regular season records qualified for the playoffs. The four division winners are seeded 1–4 based on their overall won-lost-tied record, and the wild card teams are seeded 5–7. The NFL does not use a fixed bracket playoff system, and there are no restrictions regarding teams from the same division matching up in any round. In the first round, dubbed the Wild Card playoffs, the second-seeded division winner hosts the seventh seed wild card, the third seed hosts the sixth seed, and the fourth seed hosts the fifth seed. The 1 seed from each conference receives a first-round bye. In the second round, the Divisional playoffs, the number 1 seed hosts the lowest-seeded surviving team from the first round (seed 4, 5, 6, or 7), while the other two surviving teams play each other, with the higher-seeded team hosting. The two surviving teams from each conference's divisional playoff games then meet in the respective AFC and NFC Conference Championships, hosted by the higher seed. Although the Super Bowl, the championship round of the playoffs, is played at a neutral site, the designated home team is based on an annual rotation by conference.

NFC: Los Angeles Rams 34, Carolina Panthers 31

This was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, following the Carolina Panthers' 29–23 win over the then-St. Louis Rams in the 2003 NFC Divisional Round in the opening seconds of the second overtime. This was the Panthers' first home playoff game since the 2015 NFC Championship Game, in which they beat the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 to reach Super Bowl 50. In Week 13 of this season, the Panthers upset the Rams 31–28.
The Panthers entered their first playoff game since the 2017 season as the largest home underdog in NFL playoff history. Cam Newton, the quarterback for the Panthers' last postseason game, banged the 'Keep Pounding' drum before the game. The Panthers received the ball from the opening kickoff, but were stopped on their own 45-yard line after failing on fourth down. The Rams responded quickly with a 14-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Puka Nacua. With 1:24 left in the first quarter, Rams cornerback Cobie Durant intercepted Bryce Young on the Rams' 44-yard line. After the pick, the Rams scored on a backwards pass to Nacua, who took it in for a 5-yard run. The Panthers responded with a 7-play, 65-yard drive that was capped by a 1-yard touchdown run from Chuba Hubbard to cut the score to 14–7, but a Harrison Mevis field goal on the next possession put the Rams up by 10. After forcing the Panthers to punt, Los Angeles then punted themselves, only for Panthers returner Trevor Etienne to muff the catch, allowing Troy Reeder to recover the ball on the Carolina 41-yard line. They managed to get into the red zone, but were stopped on fourth down at Carolina's 19-yard line. The Panthers made their way down the field thanks to a 28-yard pass interference penalty and a 37-yard completion to Jalen Coker, before Bryce Young scrambled 16 yards into the end zone to reduce the deficit to 3 points with 44 seconds left in the half. The Panthers' ensuing kickoff fell short of the landing zone, giving the Rams the ball on their own 40-yard line. Stafford connected with Davante Adams to move the Rams just inside Carolina territory, but on third down from the 46-yard line, the usually sure-handed Nacua dropped a long pass that would have scored a touchdown; instead, the Rams had to punt and the Panthers knelt out the half with the score at 17–14.
After forcing the Rams to go three-and-out to open the second half, the Panthers tied the score at 17 thanks to a 46-yard field goal by rookie kicker Ryan Fitzgerald with 7:29 left in the third quarter. Aided by a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty by Nick Scott for a helmet-to-helmet hit on Davante Adams, the Rams went ahead three minutes later on a 42-yard field goal by Mevis.
